            <h1>I'm an aspiring product designer based in Tallinn, Estonia.</h1>
          </div>
          <p>
            I enjoy turning a complex idea into a beautiful yet simple design,
            where every element I place has a meaning and purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although my experience might be scarce, I'm a fast learner and can
            hold my own at every challenge thrown my way. I started learning
            product design in 2019 thanks to Codesters club, a Digital Product
            program started by the Riesenkampff Foundation. At the end of 2019
            Codesters Club held a contest among all its 51 students and the top
            3 got an internship in Germany, but due to the Coronavirus, this
            internship has to wait. Fortunately, I had a great opportunity to be
            an intern as a product designer at Founderly for 4 months learning
            the basics of how to work in a company.
          </p>
          <p>
            When working on a new project, I like to ask a lot of questions that
            I consider crucial to have a clearer view of it - Who’s it for? What
            is the problem we’re trying to solve? Is THIS the best solution?
            Right after that, I go deep into creating an early prototype, the
            best starting point to continue talking about possible solutions

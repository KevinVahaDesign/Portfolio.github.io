              I'm an aspiring product designer based in Tallinn, Estonia.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy turning a complex idea into a beautiful yet simple design,
            where every element I place has a meaning and purpose.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although my experience might be scarce, I'm a fast learner and can
            hold my own at every challenge thrown my way. I started learning
            product design in 2019 thanks to Codesters club, a Digital Product
            program started by the Riesenkampff Foundation. At the end of 2019
            Codesters Club held a contest among all its 51 students and the top
            3 got an internship in Germany, but due to the Coronavirus, this
            internship has to wait. Fortunately, I had a great opportunity to be
            an intern as a product designer at Founderly for 4 months learning
            the basics of how to work in a company.
            <br />
            <br />
            When working on a new project I start with simple questions - Who's
            it for? What is the problem we're trying to solve? Is THIS the best
            solution? Asking a lot of questions is crucial for me since I have
            to fully understand the project I'm working on. When I have a good
            understanding of what I have to do I get to work making an early
            prototype and then going from there.
